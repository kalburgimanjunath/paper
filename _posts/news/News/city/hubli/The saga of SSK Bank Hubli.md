The saga of SSK Bank Hubli


Somavamsha Sahasrarjuna Kshtriya community people, as you know, are basically hard workers, industrious, kind-hearted and known well in business arena.  You may trace them in every type of business, industry and professions. The traditional business of the community was trading, weaving silk, cotton yarn and hand-loom work ancestrally.  There was no organized institution wherein these people could find their financial requirements met. Two visionaries of the community Sarvashri Janardhansa Pawar and Shri Ramachandrasa Pujari felt necessity of one such financial institution which can take care of their monetary needs for development of business and industries. 93 years back on 30.5.1921 they founded historical S.S. K. Co-operative Bank. Like any other Co-operative Banks, SSK Bank too prospered in the Banking business for many many years meeting the monetary needs of the large spectrum of the community. 

Since the year 2000 many co-operative Banks in length and breads of India, started losing their financial stability and were not in a position to return the deposits to their customers. SSK Bank too was not an exception. In un-divided Dharwad District many co-operative Banks started sinking and RBI restricted them to continue the business of Banking.  Similarly SSK Bank too was placed under moratorium and the Karnataka Co-operative Department appointed an Administrator in lieu of elected board of directors during 2003-04. 

During the year 2010 a show cause notice was issued by Reserve Bank of India under Rule 35(A) for liquidation of SSK, long lasted Bank. This was shocking news for the Society in general and the well-wishers of the Bank in particular. It was a matter of great concern that the one and the only Bank of our samaj which was a Kamadhenu for the needy people of our community is sinking.

A few alert, sincere, active  and veteran members of the community with the sole intention of reviving our only Bank with the help and timely assistance of Shri Jagdish Shettar, the then Dharwd District-in-Charge Minister and Shri K.H. Patil, President, Federation of Karnataka Co-op. Urban Banks, Bangalore and as per instructions and stipulation of the Reserve Bank of India, mobilized additional share capital of Rs. 1.5 crores with assistance of savior Shrimant Harisa Khode, Bangalore as also local kind hearted business people and social workers and also recovered more than Rs.4 crores of outstanding loans. This was possible due to the strenuous efforts of all the concerned people of the community.

Considering improvement in the financial status of the Bank, the convinced Reserve Bank of India ultimately lifted the Clause 35(A) imposed on the Bank and permitted restoration of Banking activities effective from 30th December 2011. This a land mark in the history of the Bank and it is not a matter of exaggeration if we say that the Gateway of Prosperity was re-opened for the benevolence of the community. The contribution of the Administrators appointed by the Co-operative Department was commendable. On conducting the election on 14.12.2012 elected body of Board of Directors having multifarious experience in the business, administration, education, legal and accounting Excellency took the reins of Administration of the day to day affairs of the Bank. This paved the way towards further excellence in the service of the community.
