                          SSK Brides and Bridegrooms Meet 
                                   (An Invitation to all our people)     

The SSKs are spread all over India and our community is so vast and widely spread that it has become difficult to choose the proper life companions for our daughters and sons. So to overcome this problem and to seek the right kind of life partners, we have arranged in a very big way to conduct a Meet of the prospective SSK Brides and Bridegrooms together with their parents.

                   The SSK Brides and Bridegrooms Meet is scheduled on 20.05.2015 (Wednesday) in Hubli. We earnestly request all our bandhavas to participate in this Mega Meet  and make the programme a grand success and an useful event. The prospective participants are requested to contact Sri Jagannath Vithalsa Katwe  (SSk Purohit ) Gudi Oni Cross, Chennapete, main road, old Hubli – 24.  (Mobile; 09164098299)
